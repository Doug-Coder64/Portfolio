## HTML

With the example given it was easy to see how each section of the website was going to be created. I started by adding the 'bones' of the code. Creating a header, 3 sections and a footer. 

From there I created on the __Header__, making sure to focus on the `<nav>` to make sure all links worked.

Working down to the  __Hero Section__ I found myself going back and forth from the html to css to get the site to look just right, later adding same background image to header so that it all flows as one image.

The ####__About Me__ section was pretty straight forward. Adding a paragraph section and using https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html to get filler text.

There was some difficulty getting the __Work Section__ to look right. Creating the background images and then getting CSS hovering to make the image show more clear was where I struggled the most.

Finally the __Contact Section__ was created pretty easy. Using *tel:* and *mailto:* I was able to add links so when the user clicks on the telephone or email it will open their default apps for telephone and email.

## CSS

I used a lot of flex in the CSS making it pretty easy to adjust for different screen sizes.

Also for font sizes I used the Viewpoint Width (vw) so that font sizes adjusted according to screen size. 

Again there was a lot of back and forth on the work section to get it just right. Adding multiple classes for different sections.
