# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## HTML

With the example given it was easy to see how each section of the website was going to be created. I started by adding the 'bones' of the code. Creating a header, 3 sections and a footer. 

From there I created on the __Header__, making sure to focus on the `<nav>` to make sure all links worked.

Working down to the  __Hero Section__ I found myself going back and forth from the html to css to get the site to look just right, later adding same background image to header so that it all flows as one image.

The ####__About Me__ section was pretty straight forward. Adding a paragraph section and using https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html to get filler text.

There was some difficulty getting the __Work Section__ to look right. Creating the background images and then getting CSS hovering to make the image show more clear was where I struggled the most.

Finally the __Contact Section__ was created pretty easy. Using *tel:* and *mailto:* I was able to add links so when the user clicks on the telephone or email it will open their default apps for telephone and email.

## CSS

I used a lot of flex in the CSS making it pretty easy to adjust for different screen sizes.

Also for font sizes I used the Viewpoint Width (vw) so that font sizes adjusted according to screen size. 

Again there was a lot of back and forth on the work section to get it just right. Adding multiple classes for different sections.
